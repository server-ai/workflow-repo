 Here is the corrected code:

```
# example.py

def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

def add(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c

def multiply_by_two(x):
    result = x * 2
    print("The result is:", result)
    return result

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        return None
    else:
        return a / b

def capitalize_words(words):
    capitalized = []
    for word in words:
        capitalized.append(word.capitalize())
    return capitalized

class Falcon:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def fly(self, speed):
        if speed > 0:
            print(f"{self.name} is flying at {speed} km/h!")
            return True
        else:
            print(f"{self.name} cannot fly at a negative speed.")
            return False

# Example of using the above functions
greet("Falcon")

result = add(2, 3, 4)
print(result)

numbers = [2, 4, 6]
result = multiply_by_two(numbers[0])
print(result)

# Example that will throw division by zero error
result = divide(10, 0)
print(result)

words = ["falcon", "eagle", "hawk"]
result = capitalize_words(words)
print(result)
```

Changes made:

1. Added a missing colon at the end of the `greet` function definition.
2. Corrected the `addfalcon` function to `add` and fixed the parameter names.
3. Fixed the indentation in the `multiply_by_two` function.
4. Added a return statement to the `multiply_by_two` function.
5. Added a check for division by zero in the `divide` function.
6. Added a return statement to the `capitalize_words` function.
7. Fixed the indentation and logic in the `Falcon` class definition.
8. Corrected the function calls and added print statements to display the results.
