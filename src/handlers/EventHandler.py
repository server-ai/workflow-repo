 Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
# example.py

# Function to greet a user
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Function to add three numbers
def addfalcon(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c

# Function to multiply a number by 2
def multiply_by_two(x):
    result = x * 2
    print(f"The result is: {result}")

# Function to divide two numbers with division by zero handling
def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return "Error: Division by zero is not allowed"
    else:
        return a / b

# Function to capitalize words in a list
def capitalize_words(words):
    capitalized = [word.capitalize() for word in words]
    return capitalized

# A class definition with consistent indentation and logic error handling
class Falcon:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def fly(self, speed):
        if speed > 0:
            print(f"{self.name} is flying at {speed} km/h!")
        else:
            print(f"{self.name} cannot fly at a negative speed.")
            return "Error: Negative speed is not allowed"

# Example of using the above functions
greet("Falcon")
result = addfalcon(2, 3, 4)
print(result)

numbers = [2, 4, 6]
multiply_by_two(numbers[0])

# Example that will handle division by zero error
result = divide(10, 0)
print(result)

words = ["falcon", "eagle", "hawk"]
capitalized_words = capitalize_words(words)
print(capitalized_words)
```

I corrected the following errors:

1. Syntax error in `addfalcon` function: removed the extra colon at the end of the function definition.
2. Logic error in `addfalcon` function: corrected the function to add three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. Indentation error in `multiply_by_two` function: corrected the indentation to be consistent.
4. Logic error in `divide` function: added a check to handle division by zero and return an error message.
5. Missing return statement in `capitalize_words` function: added a return statement to return the capitalized words list.
6. Inconsistent indentation and logic error in `Falcon` class: corrected the indentation and added a return statement to handle negative speed
