 Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
# example.py

# Function to greet a user
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Function to add three numbers
def add_falcon(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c

# Function to multiply a number by 2
def multiply_by_two(x):
    result = x * 2
    print(f"The result is: {result}")

# Function to divide two numbers, handling division by zero
def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return "Error: Division by zero is not allowed"
    else:
        return a / b

# Function to capitalize words in a list
def capitalize_words(words):
    capitalized = [word.capitalize() for word in words]
    return capitalized

# A class definition with consistent indentation and logic
class Falcon:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def fly(self, speed):
        if speed > 0:
            print(f"{self.name} is flying at {speed} km/h!")
        else:
            print(f"{self.name} cannot fly at a negative speed.")
            return "Invalid speed"

# Example of using the above functions
greet("Falcon")
result = add_falcon(2, 3, 4)
print(result)

numbers = [2, 4, 6]
result = multiply_by_two(numbers[0])
print(result)

# Example that will handle division by zero error
try:
    result = divide(10, 0)
    print(result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed")

words = ["falcon", "eagle", "hawk"]
result = capitalize_words(words)
print(result)
```

I fixed the following issues:

1.  Syntax error in `addfalcon` function.
2.  Logic error in `addfalcon` function (undefined variable 'b').
3.  Indentation error in `multiply_by_two` function.
4.  Missing return statement in `capitalize_words` function.
5.  Inconsistent indentation and logic error in `Falcon` class.
6.  Division by zero error in `divide` function.
7.  Incorrect function calls and printing.
